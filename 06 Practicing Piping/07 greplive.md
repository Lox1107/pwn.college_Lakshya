# Grepping live outputs
The challenge asks us to pipe(|) the stdout of /challenge/run into the grep command so we can search its output for the flag without writing it to a file first.
***

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{U8YO_dP9MXnHs7S7qz0LwOKcY2X.QX5EDO0wCNzEzNzEzW}`

I piped the /challenge/run programâ€™s output into grep with the search pattern as pwn.college to find the flag from the live output.
```
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/8b4vn1iyn6kqiisjvlmv67d1c0p3j6wj-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stdout!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
pwn.college{U8YO_dP9MXnHs7S7qz0LwOKcY2X.QX5EDO0wCNzEzNzEzW}

## What I learned
I  learned that we can use | to pipe the stdout of a program into the stdin of another command without saving it to a file.
