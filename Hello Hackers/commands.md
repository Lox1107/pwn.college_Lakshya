# Intro to Commands
The challenge asks us to invoke the **hello** command on the command line to get the flag.

***

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{sqlG9NohwOb9nyIgz3pxVsBru3a.QX3YjM1wCNzEzNzEzW}'

When I executed the hello command, the flag was output to the terminal.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sqlG9NohwOb9nyIgz3pxVsBru3a.QX3YjM1wCNzEzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learnt how to invoke commands on the Linux Terminal and that commands are case-sensitive. Also, when a command terminated, the shell shows the prompt to enter another command.
