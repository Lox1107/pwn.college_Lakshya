# Position elsewhere
The challenge asks us to execute the /challenge/run program, but from a specific directory that it tells us to move into first. To do this, it tells use the cd(change directory) command to change our current working directory, and then run the program.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0N0aaDZ6Aq2QVSxJd7bie61fYWe.QX4QTN0wCNzEzNzEzW}`

I first invoked the /challenge/run program but the shell told me that I had to be in a different working directory (/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia). I changed my current working directory to that directory using the cd command and invoked /challenge/run to get the flag.

```
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0N0aaDZ6Aq2QVSxJd7bie61fYWe.QX4QTN0wCNzEzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned how to use the cd command to change the current working directory of the shell. The command prompt shows which directory the shell is currently in, and ~ refers to the home directory. Some programs require you to run them from a specific directory, so knowing how to change your current working directory to the right one is important.
